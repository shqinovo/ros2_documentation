"The ``sros2`` package provides the tools and instructions to use ROS 2 on"
" top of DDS-Security. The security features have been tested across "
"platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) as well as across different "
"languages (C++ and Python). The SROS2 has been designed to work with any "
"secure middleware, although not all middleware is open source and support"
" varies depending on the ROS distribution in use. Please reach out to the"
" :ref:`ROS 2 Security Working Group <Security Working Group>` if you "
"encounter any support issues."
