"This tutorial will teach you how to integrate a custom allocator for "
"publishers and subscribers so that the default heap allocator is never "
"called while your ROS nodes are executing. The code for this tutorial is "

"Suppose you want to write real-time safe code, and you've heard about the"
" many dangers of calling ``new`` during the real-time critical section, "

"By default, many C++ standard library structures will implicitly allocate"
" memory as they grow, such as ``std::vector``. However, these data "
"structures also accept an \"Allocator\" template argument. If you specify"
" a custom allocator to one of these data structures, it will use that "
"allocator instead of the system allocator to grow or shrink the data "
"structure. Your custom allocator could have a pool of memory preallocated"
" on the stack, which might be better suited to real-time applications."

"In the ROS 2 C++ client library (rclcpp), we are following a similar "
"philosophy to the C++ standard library. Publishers, subscribers, and the "
"Executor accept an Allocator template parameter that controls allocations"
" made by that entity during execution."

"Since C++17, the standard library provides something called "

"The IntraProcessManager is a class that is usually hidden from the user, "
"but in order to pass a custom allocator to it we need to expose it by "
