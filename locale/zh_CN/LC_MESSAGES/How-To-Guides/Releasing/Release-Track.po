"Bloom requires the user to enter configuration information when releasing"

msgid ""
"Since some of the configurations will differ when releasing the package "
"for different ROS distributions, bloom uses **release tracks to store the"

"should create tracks with the same name as the ROS distro you are "
"releasing for."
