"All of the current ROS middleware implementations are based on full or "
"partial DDS implementations. For example, there is a middleware "
"implementation that uses RTI's Connext DDS and an implementation which "
"uses eProsima's Fast DDS. Because of this, there are some shared "
"|packages| amongst most DDS based middleware implementations."

"The ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| generates a DDS ``.idl`` file "

"make use of this generator's output ``.idl`` files to generate pre-"

"A ROS middleware implementation is typically made up of a few |packages| "

"``<implementation_name>_cmake_module``: contains CMake Module for "

"``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>``: contains the implementation of "

msgid ""
"The ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module`` |package| contains any CMake "
"Modules and functions needed to find the supporting dependencies for the "
"middleware implementation. For example, ``rti_connext_dds_cmake_module`` "
"provides wrapper logic around the CMake Module shipped with RTI Connext "
"DDS to make sure that all packages that depend on it will select the same"
" installation of RTI Connext DDS. Similarly, ``fastrtps_cmake_module`` "
"includes a CMake Module to find eProsima's Fast DDS and "
"``gurumdds_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find GurumNetworks "
"GurumDDS. Not all implementations will have a package like this: for "
"example, Eclipe's Cyclone DDS already provides a CMake Module which is "
"used directly by its RMW implementation without the need of additional "
"wrappers."

"The ``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| implements the "
"``rmw`` C |API| in a particular language. The implementation itself can "

"The ``rosidl_typesupport_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| "
"provides a generator which generates DDS code in a particular language. "
"This is done using the ``.idl`` files generated by the "
"``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| and the DDS IDL code generator "
"provided by the DDS vendor. It also generates code for converting ROS "
"message structures to and from DDS message structures. This generator is "
"also responsible for creating a shared library for the message package it"
" is being used in, which is specific to the messages in the message "
"package and to the DDS vendor being used."

"As mentioned above, the ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_<language>`` "
"may be used instead of a vendor specific type support package if an rmw "
"implementation supports runtime interpretation of messages. This ability "
"to programmatically send and receive types over topics without generating"
" code beforehand is achieved by supporting the `DDS X-Types Dynamic Data "
"standard <http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes>`_. As such, rmw "
"implementations may provide support for the X-Types standard, and/or "
"provide a package for type support generated at compile time specific to "
"their DDS implementation."
