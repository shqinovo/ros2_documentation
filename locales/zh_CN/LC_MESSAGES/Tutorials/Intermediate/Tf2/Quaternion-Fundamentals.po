"A quaternion is a 4-tuple representation of orientation, which is more "
"concise than a rotation matrix. Quaternions are very efficient for "
"analyzing situations where rotations in three dimensions are involved. "
"Quaternions are used widely in robotics, quantum mechanics, computer "
"vision, and 3D animation."

"ROS 2 uses quaternions to track and apply rotations. A quaternion has 4 "
"components ``(x, y, z, w)``. In ROS 2, ``w`` is last, but in some "
"libraries like Eigen, ``w`` can be placed at the first position. The "
"commonly-used unit quaternion that yields no rotation about the x/y/z "
"axes is ``(0, 0, 0, 1)``, and can be created in a following way:"
