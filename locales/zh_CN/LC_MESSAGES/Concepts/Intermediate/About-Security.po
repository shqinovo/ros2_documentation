"ROS 2 includes the ability to secure communications among nodes within "
"the ROS 2 computational graph. Similar to discovery, security happens "
"through the underlying ROS 2 middleware (provided it has support for the "
"corresponding security plugins). No additional software installation is "
"needed to enable security; however, the middleware requires configuration"
" files for each ROS graph participant. These files enable encryption and "
"authentication, and define policies both for individual nodes and for the"
" overall ROS graph. ROS 2 also adds a master \"on/off\" switch to control"
" security behavior."

"ROS utilities can create the authoritative `trust anchor "

"Built-in ROS 2 security features enable control over communications "
"throughout the ROS graph. This not only allows for encrypting data in "
"transit between ROS domain participants, but also enables authentication "
"of participants sending data, ensures the integrity of data being sent, "
"and enables domain-wide access controls."

"ROS 2 security services are provided by the underlying `Data Distribution"
" Service (DDS) <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/>`_ which is used for "
"communications between nodes. DDS vendors provide open source and "
"commercial DDS implementations that work with ROS. However, in order to "
"create a specification-compliant implementation of DDS, all vendors must "
"include security plugins as outlined in the `DDS Security Specification "
"<https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-SECURITY/About-DDS-SECURITY/>`_. ROS "
"security features take advantage of these DDS security plugins to provide"
" policy-based encryption, authentication and access control. DDS and ROS "
"security is enabled through predefined configuration files and "
"environment variables."

msgid ""
"A security enclave encapsulates a single policy for protecting ROS "
"communications. The enclave may set policy for multiple nodes, for an "
"entire ROS graph, or any combination of protected ROS processes and "
"devices. Security enclaves can be flexibly mapped to processes, users, or"
" devices at deployment. Adjusting this default behavior becomes important"
" for optimizing communications and for complex systems. See the ROS 2 "
"Security Enclaves `design document "
"<https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros2_security_enclaves.html>`_ for "
"additional details."

"A `ROS 2 security enclave "
"<https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros2_security_enclaves.html>`_ is "
"established with six files as outlined by the DDS specification. Three of"
" these files define an enclave's identity, while three other files define"
" the permissions to be granted to the enclave. All six files reside in a "
"single directory, and nodes launched without a qualified enclave path use"
" files in the default root level enclave."

msgid "Enclave Identity"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Security.rst:52
msgid ""
"The Identity Certificate Authority file ``identity_ca.cert.pem`` acts as "
"the trust anchor used to identify participants. Each enclave also holds "
"its unique identifying certificate in the file ``cert.pem``, and the "
"associated private key in the file ``key.pem``. Because the ``cert.pem`` "
"certificate has been signed by identity certificate, when a participant "
"presents this certificate to other domain members, they are able to "
"validate the participant's identity using their own copy of the identity "
"certificate. This valid certificate exchange allows the enclave to "
"securely establish trusted communications with other participants. The "
"enclave does not not share the ``key.pem`` private key, but only uses it "
"for decryption and message signing."

msgid "Enclave Permissions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Security.rst:61
msgid ""
"The Permissions Certificate Authority file ``permissions_ca.cert.pem`` "
"serves as the trust anchor to grant permissions to security enclaves. "
"This certificate is used to create the signed file ``governance.p7s``, an"
" XML document which defines domain-wide protection policies. Similarly "
"the XML file ``permissions.p7s`` outlines permissions of this particular "
"enclave and has been signed by the Permissions CA. Domain members use a "
"copy of the permissions CA to validate these signed files and grant the "
"requested access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Security.rst:66
msgid ""
"Although these two certificate authorities enable separate workflows for "
"identity and permissions, often the same certificate serves as both the "
"identity and the permissions authority."

msgid "Private Keys"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Security.rst:71
msgid ""
"The identity and permissions certificates also have associated private "
"key files. Add new enclaves to the domain by signing their Certificate "
"Signing Request (CSR) with the identity certificate's private key. "
"Similarly, grant permissions for a new enclave by signing a permissions "
"XML document with the permission certificate's private key."

msgid ""
"The environment variable ``ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE`` acts as the enclave's "
"master \"on/off\" switch for ROS 2 security features. Security has been "
"turned off by default, so security features will not be enabled even when"
" the proper security files are present. In order to enable ROS 2 "
"security, set this environment variable to ``true`` (case sensitive)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Security.rst:83
msgid ""
"Once security has been enabled, the environment variable "
"``ROS_SECURITY_STRATEGY`` defines how domain participants handle problems"
" when launching participants. Security features depend on certificates "
"and properly signed configuration files, yet by default, an improperly "
"configured participant will still launch successfully but without "
"security features. In order to enforce strict compliance with security "
"settings and fail to launch non-compliant enclaves, set this environment "
"variable to ``Enforce`` (case sensitive)."

msgid ""
"Additional security-related environment variables can be found in the "
"`ROS 2 DDS-Security Integration design document "
"<https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros2_dds_security.html>`_. These "
"variables generally assist ROS in managing enclaves and locating the "
"security files."
