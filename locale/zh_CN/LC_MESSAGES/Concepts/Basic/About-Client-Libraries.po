"Client libraries are the APIs that allow users to implement their ROS 2 "
"code. Using client libraries, users gain access to ROS 2 concepts such as"
" nodes, topics, services, etc. Client libraries come in a variety of "
"programming languages so that users may write ROS 2 code in the language "
"that is best-suited for their application. For example, you might prefer "
"to write visualization tools in Python because it makes prototyping "
"iterations faster, while for parts of your system that are concerned with"
" efficiency, the nodes might be better implemented in C++."

"The ROS Client Library for Python (``rclpy``) is the Python counterpart "

"builds on top of the ``rcl`` C API for its implementation. The interface "
"provides an idiomatic Python experience that uses native Python types and"
" patterns like lists and context objects. By using the ``rcl`` |API| in "
"the implementation, it stays consistent with the other client libraries "
"in terms of feature parity and behavior. In addition to providing Python "
"idiomatic bindings around the ``rcl`` |API| and Python classes for each "
"message, the Python client library takes care of the execution model, "
"using ``threading.Thread`` or similar to run the functions in the ``rcl``"
" |API|."

"Like C++ it generates custom Python code for each ROS message that the "

" into the ``rcl`` layer, at which point they are converted into the plain"
" C version of the message so it can be passed into the ``rcl`` C |API|. "

"Most of the functionality found in a client library is not specific to "
"the programming language of the client library. For example, the behavior"
" of parameters and the logic of namespaces should ideally be the same "
"across all programming languages. Because of this, rather than "
"implementing the common functionality from scratch, client libraries make"
" use of a common core ROS Client Library (RCL) interface that implements "
"logic and behavior of ROS concepts that is not language-specific. As a "
"result, client libraries only need to wrap the common functionality in "
"the RCL with foreign function interfaces. This keeps client libraries "
"thinner and easier to develop. For this reason the common RCL "
"functionality is exposed with C interfaces as the C language is typically"
" the easiest language for client libraries to wrap."

"In addition to making the client libraries light-weight, an advantage of "
"having the common core is that the behavior between languages is more "
"consistent. If any changes are made to the logic/behavior of the "
"functionality in the core RCL -- namespaces, for example -- all client "
"libraries that use the RCL will have these changes reflected. "
"Furthermore, having the common core means that maintaining multiple "
"client libraries becomes less work when it comes to bug fixes."
