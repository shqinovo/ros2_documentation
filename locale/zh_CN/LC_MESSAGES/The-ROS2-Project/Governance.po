"Since the beginning of ROS, the project has been overseen and prioritized"
" primarily by one organization, first Willow Garage and now Open "
"Robotics. That approach has worked well enough, as evidenced by the "
"widespread adoption of ROS around the world."

"But with ROS 2, we want to broaden participation to accelerate ROS 2 "
"delivery, starting with these areas: determining the roadmap, developing "
"core tools and libraries, and establishing working groups to focus on "
"important topics. To that end, we've established a Technical Steering "
"Committee (TSC). As described in the :doc:`charter <Governance/ROS2-TSC-"
"Charter>`, the TSC comprises representatives of organizations that are "
"contributing to the development of ROS 2, and it has the responsibility "
"to set the technical direction for the project."
