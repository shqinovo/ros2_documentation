"There are several potential reasons for this. First, release jobs build "
"against a minimal ROS installation to check if all dependencies are "
"properly declared in the `package manifest`_. Devel jobs / github actions"
" / local builds may be performed in an environment that has the "
"dependencies already installed, therefore does not notice dependency "
"issues. Second, they might build different versions of the source code. "
"While devel jobs / github actions / local builds usually build the latest"
" version from the *upstream* [2]_ repository, `release jobs`_ build the "
"source code of the latest release, i.e. the source code in the respective"
" *upstream* branches of the *release* repository [3]_."
