"An API, or Application Programming Interface, is an interface that is "
"provided by an \"application\", which in this case is usually a shared "
"library or other language appropriate shared resource. APIs are made up "
"of files that define a contract between the software using the interface "
"and the software providing the interface. These files typically manifest "
"as header files in C and C++ and as Python files in Python. In either "
"case it is important that APIs are grouped and described in documentation"
" and that they are declared as either public or private. Public "
"interfaces are subject to change rules and changes to the public "
"interfaces prompt a new version number of the software that provides "
"them."
