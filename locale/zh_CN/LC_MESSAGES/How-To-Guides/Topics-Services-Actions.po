"When designing a system there are three primary styles of interfaces. The"
" specifications for the content is in the :doc:`Interfaces Overview "
"<../Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces>`. This is written to provide the "
"reader with guidelines about when to use each type of interface."

"Are for continuous data flow. Data might be published and subscribed at "
"any time independent of any senders/receivers. Many to many connection. "
"Callbacks receive data once it is available. The publisher decides when "
"data is sent."

"Should be used for remote procedure calls that terminate quickly, e.g. "
"for querying the state of a node or doing a quick calculation such as IK."
" They should never be used for longer running processes, in particular "
"processes that might be required to preempt if exceptional situations "
"occur and they should never change or depend on state to avoid unwanted "
"side effects for other nodes."

"Simple blocking call. Mostly used for comparably fast tasks as requesting"

"The most important property of actions is that they can be preempted and "

"Actions can keep state for the lifetime of a goal, i.e. if executing two "
"action goals in parallel on the same server, for each client a separate "
"state instance can be kept since the goal is uniquely identified by its "
"id."

"Slow perception routines which take several seconds to terminate or "

"More complex non-blocking background processing. Used for longer tasks "
