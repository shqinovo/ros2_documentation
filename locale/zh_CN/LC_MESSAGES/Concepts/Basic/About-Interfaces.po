"ROS applications typically communicate through interfaces of one of three"
" types: :doc:`topics <About-Topics>`, :doc:`services <About-Services>`, "
"or :doc:`actions <About-Actions>`. ROS 2 uses a simplified description "
"language, the interface definition language (IDL), to describe these "
"interfaces. This description makes it easy for ROS tools to automatically"
" generate source code for the interface type in several target languages."
