"In ROS 2, a service refers to a remote procedure call. In other words, a "
"node can make a remote procedure call to another node which will do a "
"computation and return a result."

"In ROS 2, services are expected to return quickly, as the client is "
"generally waiting on the result. Services should never be used for longer"
" running processes, in particular processes that might need to be "
"preempted for exceptional situations. If you have a service that will be "
"doing a long-running computation, consider using an :doc:`action <About-"
"Actions>` instead."

"Services are identified by a service name, which looks much like a topic "

"A service server is the entity that will accept a remote procedure "
"request, and perform some computation on it. For instance, suppose the "
"ROS 2 message contains the following:"

"The service server would be the entity that receives this message, adds "
"``a`` and ``b`` together, and returns the ``sum``."

"There should only ever be one service server per service name. It is "
"undefined which service server will receive client requests in the case "
"of multiple service servers on the same service name."

msgid "Service client"

#: ../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Services.rst:49
msgid ""
"A service client is an entity that will request a remote service server "
"to perform a computation on its behalf. Following from the example above,"
" the service client is the entity that creates the initial message "
"containing ``a`` and ``b``, and waits for the service server to compute "
"the sum and return the result."

"Unlike the service server, there can be arbitrary numbers of service "
"clients using the same service name."
