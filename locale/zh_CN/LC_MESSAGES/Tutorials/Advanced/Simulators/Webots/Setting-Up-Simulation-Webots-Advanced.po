"In this tutorial you will extend the package created in the first part of"
" the tutorial: :doc:`./Setting-Up-Simulation-Webots-Basic`. The aim is to"
" implement a ROS 2 node that avoids obstacles using the robot's distance "
"sensors. This tutorial focuses on using robot devices with the "

"As mentioned in :doc:`./Setting-Up-Simulation-Webots-Basic`, "
"``webots_ros2_driver`` contains plugins to interface most of Webots "
"devices with ROS 2 directly. These plugins can be loaded using the "
"``<device>`` tag in the URDF file of the robot. The ``reference`` "
"attribute should match the Webots device ``name`` parameter. The list of "
"all existing interfaces and the corresponding parameters can be found `on"
" the devices reference page "
"<https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/References-Devices>`_. "
"For available devices that are not configured in the URDF file, the "
"interface will be automatically created and default values will be used "
"for ROS parameters (e.g. ``update rate``, ``topic name``, and ``frame "
"name``)."
