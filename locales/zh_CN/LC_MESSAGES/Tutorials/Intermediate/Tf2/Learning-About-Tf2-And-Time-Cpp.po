"In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a "
":doc:`tf2 broadcaster <Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Cpp>` and a :doc:`tf2 "
"listener <Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Cpp>`. We also learned how to :doc:`add "
"a new frame to the transformation tree <./Adding-A-Frame-Cpp>` and "
"learned how tf2 keeps track of a tree of coordinate frames. This tree "
"changes over time, and tf2 stores a time snapshot for every transform "
"(for up to 10 seconds by default). Until now we used the "
"``lookupTransform()`` function to get access to the latest available "
"transforms in that tf2 tree, without knowing at what time that transform "
"was recorded. This tutorial will teach you how to get a transform at a "
"specific time."

"To understand why is this happening we need to understand how buffers "

"coordinate transforms coming from the different tf2 broadcasters. "
"Secondly, when a broadcaster sends out a transform, it takes some time "
"before that transform gets into the buffer (usually a couple of "
"milliseconds). As a result, when you request a frame transform at time "
"\"now\", you should wait a few milliseconds for that information to "
