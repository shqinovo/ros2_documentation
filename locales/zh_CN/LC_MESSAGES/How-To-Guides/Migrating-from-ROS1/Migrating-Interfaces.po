"The way in which interfaces are built in ROS 2 differs substantially from"
" ROS 1. Interfaces can only be built from packages containing a "
"``CMakeLists.txt``. If you are developing a pure Python package, then the"
" interfaces should be placed in a different package containing only the "
"interfaces (which is best practice anyway). See the :doc:`custom "
"interfaces tutorial<../../Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Custom-"
"ROS2-Interfaces>` for more information."
