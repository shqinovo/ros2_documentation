"As explained elsewhere, the default middleware that ROS 2 uses for "
"communication is DDS. In DDS, the primary mechanism for having different "
"logical networks share a physical network is known as the Domain ID. ROS "
"2 nodes on the same domain can freely discover and send messages to each "
"other, while ROS 2 nodes on different domains cannot. All ROS 2 nodes use"
" domain ID 0 by default. To avoid interference between different groups "
"of computers running ROS 2 on the same network, a different domain ID "
"should be set for each group."

"The domain ID is used by DDS to compute the UDP ports that will be used "
"for discovery and communication. See `this article "
"<https://community.rti.com/content/forum-topic/statically-configure-"
"firewall-let-omg-dds-traffic-through>`__ for details on how the ports are"
" computed. Remembering our basic networking, the UDP port is an `unsigned"
" 16-bit integer "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#Ports>`__. Thus, "
"the highest port number that can be allocated is 65535. Doing some math "
"with the formula in the article above, this means that the highest domain"
" ID that can possibly be assigned is 232, while the lowest that can be "
"assigned is 0."

"For maximum compatibility, some additional platform-specific constraints "
"should be followed when choosing a domain ID. In particular, it is best "
"to avoid allocating domain IDs in the operating system's `ephemeral port "
"range <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port>`__. This avoids "
"possible conflicts between the ports used by the ROS 2 nodes and other "
"networking services on the computers."
