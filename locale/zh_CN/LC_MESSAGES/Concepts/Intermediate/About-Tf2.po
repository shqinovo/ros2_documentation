"tf2 is the transform library, which lets the user keep track of multiple "
"coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains the relationship between "
"coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time and lets the user "
"transform points, vectors, etc. between any two coordinate frames at any "
"desired point in time."

"A robotic system typically has many 3D coordinate frames that change over"
" time, such as a world frame, base frame, gripper frame, head frame, etc."
" tf2 keeps track of all these frames over time, and allows you to ask "
"questions like:"

"tf2 can operate in a distributed system. This means all the information "
"about the coordinate frames of a robot is available to all ROS 2 "
"components on any computer in the system. tf2 can have every component in"
" your distributed system build its own transform information database or "
"have a central node that gathers and stores all transform information."

"If you want to use tf2 to transform between coordinate frames, your nodes"
" will need to listen for transforms. What you will do is receive and "

"To extend the capabilities of a robot, you will need to start "
"broadcasting transforms. Broadcasting transforms means to send out the "
"relative pose of coordinate frames to the rest of the system. A system "
"can have many broadcasters that each provide information about a "
"different part of the robot. Check out the \"Writing a broadcaster\" "
"tutorial :doc:`(Python) <../../Tutorials/Intermediate/Tf2/Writing-A-Tf2"

"In addition to that, tf2 can broadcast static transforms that do not "
"change over time. This mainly saves storage and lookup time, but also "
"reduces the publishing overhead. You should note that static transforms "
"are published once and assumed to not change, so no history is stored. If"
" you want to define static transforms in your tf2 tree, take a look at "
"the \"Writing a static broadcaster\" :doc:`(Python) "
