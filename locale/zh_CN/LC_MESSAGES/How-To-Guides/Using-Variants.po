"Some platforms have tools for creating basic packages that do not require"
" a full ROS build farm environment or equivalent infrastructure. It is "
"possible to use these tools to create platform-dependent variants. This "
"approach does not include support for ROS packaging tools and is platform"
" dependent but requires much less infrastructure to produce if you are "
"creating collections of existing packages rather than a mix of public and"
" private ROS packages. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu systems you can "
"use the ``equivs`` utilities. The Debian Administrator's handbook has a "
"`Section on meta-packages <https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-"
