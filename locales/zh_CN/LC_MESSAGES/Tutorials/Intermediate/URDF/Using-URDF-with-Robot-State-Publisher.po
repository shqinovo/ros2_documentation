"This tutorial will show you how to model a walking robot, publish the "
"state as a `tf2 <https://wiki.ros.org/tf2>`__ message and view the "
"simulation in Rviz. First, we create the URDF model describing the robot "
"assembly. Next we write a node which simulates the motion and publishes "
"the JointState and transforms. We then use ``robot_state_publisher`` to "
"publish the entire robot state to ``/tf2``."
