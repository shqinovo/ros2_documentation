"A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages. These are akin to "
"Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu). The purpose of the ROS distributions "
"is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they"
" are ready to roll everything forward. Therefore once a distribution is "
"released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking "
"improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full). "
"That generally applies to the whole community, but for \"higher\" level "
"packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers "
"of a given package to avoid breaking changes."
