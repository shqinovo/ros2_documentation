"ROS 2 communications security is all about protecting communications "
"between nodes. Prior tutorials enabled security, but how can you "
"**really** tell if traffic is being encrypted? In this tutorial we'll "
"take a look at capturing live network traffic to show the difference "
"between encrypted and unencrypted traffic."

"``rmw_fastrtps_cpp`` uses `Shared Memory Transport <https://fast-"
"dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/shared_memory/shared_memory.html>`_"
" by default to improve the performance in the transport layer when the "
"endpoints are in the same host system. Security enclaves are still "
"applied, and data will be encrypted. However, you cannot capture live "
"network traffic since the data will not be on the network interface. If "
"you are using  ``rmw_fastrtps_cpp``, you need to either go through this "
"tutorial and use a different host system between the publisher and "
"subscriber, or disable shared memory transport with `Enabling UDP "
