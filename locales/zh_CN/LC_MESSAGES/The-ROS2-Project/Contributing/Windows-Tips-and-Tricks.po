"ROS 2 supports Windows 10 as a Tier 1 platform, which means that all code"
" that goes into the ROS 2 core must support Windows. For those used to "
"traditional development on Linux or other Unix-like systems, developing "
"on Windows can be a bit of a challenge. This document aims to lay out "
"some of those differences."

"characters are always used by the drive letter, colon, initial backslash,"

"The Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler (MSVC) exposes symbols from a Dynamic "
"Link Library (DLL) only if they are explicitly exported. The clang and "
"gcc compilers have an option to do the same, but it is off by default. As"
" a result, when a library previously built on Linux is built on Windows, "
"other libraries may be unable to resolve the external symbols. Below are "
"examples of common error messages which can be caused by symbols not "
"being exposed:"

"Symbol Visibility also impacts binary loading. If you are finding that a "
"composable node does not run or a Qt Visualizer isn't working, it may be "
"that the hosting process can not find an expected symbol export from the "
"binary. To diagnose this on Windows, the Windows developer tools includes"
" a program called Gflags to enable various options. One of those options "
"is called *Loader Snaps* which enables you to detect load failures while "
"debugging. Please visit the Microsoft Documentation for more information "
"on `Gflags <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-"

"Two solutions to export symbols on Windows are Visibility Control Headers"
" and the ``WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS`` property. Microsoft recommends "
"ROS developers use Visibility Control Headers to control the export of "
"symbols from a binary. Visibility Control Headers provide more control "
"over the symbol export macro and offer other benefits including smaller "
"binary size and reduced link times."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Windows-Tips-and-Tricks.rst:61
msgid ""
"The purpose of Visibility Control Headers headers is to define a macro "
"for each shared library which correctly declares symbols as dllimport or "
"dllexport. This is decided based on whether the library is being consumed"
" or being built itself. The logic in the macro also takes the compiler "
"into account and includes logic to select the appropriate syntax. The "
"`GCC visibility documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>`__ "
"includes step by step instructions for adding explicit symbol visibility "
"to a library “yielding the highest quality code with the greatest "
"reductions in binary size, load times and link times”. A header named "
"``visibility_control.h`` can be placed in the ``includes`` folder for "
"each library as shown in the example below. The example below shows how a"
" visibility control header would be added for a ``my_lib`` library with a"
" class called ``example_class``. Add a visibility header to the include "
"folder for the library. The boiler plate logic is used with the library "
"name used in the macro to make it unique in the project. In another "
"library, ``MY_LIB`` would be replaced with the library name."

"To use the macro, add ``MY_LIB_PUBLIC`` before symbols which need to be "

"CMake implements the ``WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS`` property on Windows, "
"which causes function symbols to be automatically exported. More detail "
"of how it works can be found in the `WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS CMake "
"Documentation "

"Note that a binary on Windows can only export 65,536 symbols. If a binary"
" exports more than that, you will get an error and should use the "
"visibility_control headers. There is an exception to this method in the "
"case of global data symbols. For example, a global static data member "
"like the one below."

"In these cases dllimprort/dllexport must be applied explicitly. This can "

"Finally, it is important that the header file that exports the symbols be"
" included into at least one of the ``.cpp`` files in the package so that "
"the macros will get expanded and placed into the resulting binary. "

msgid ""
"When building in Debug mode on Windows, several very important things "
"change. The first is that all DLLs get ``_d`` automatically appended to "
"the library name. So if the library is called ``libfoo.dll``, in Debug "
"mode it will be ``libfoo_d.dll``. The dynamic linker on Windows also "
"knows to look for libraries of that form, so it will not find libraries "
"without the ``_d`` prefix. Additionally, Windows turns on a whole set of "
"compile-time and run-time checks in Debug mode that is far more strict "
"than Release builds. For these reasons, it is a good idea to run a "
"Windows Debug build and test on many pull requests."

#: ../../source/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Windows-Tips-and-Tricks.rst:157
msgid ""
"In Windows the default path separator is a backslash (``\\``), which "
"differs from the forward-slash (``/``) used in Linux and macOS. Most of "
"the Windows APIs can deal with either as a path separator, but this is "
"not universally true. For instance, the ``cmd.exe`` shell can only do "
"tab-completion when using the backslash character, not the forward-slash."
" For maximum compatibility on Windows, a backslash should always be used "
"as the path separator on Windows."

msgid ""
"When vendoring a package in ROS 2, it is often necessary to apply a patch"
" to fix a bug, add a feature, etc. The typical way to do this is to "
"modify the ``ExternalProject_add`` call to add a ``PATCH`` command, using"
" the ``patch`` executable. Unfortunately, the ``patch`` executable as "
"delivered by chocolatey requires Administrator access to run. The "
"workaround is to use ``git apply-patch`` when applying patches to "
"external projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Windows-Tips-and-Tricks.rst:169
msgid ""
"``git apply-patch`` has its own issues in that it only works properly "
"when applied to a git repository. For that reason, external projects "
"should always use the ``GIT`` method to obtain the project and then use "

#: ../../source/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Windows-Tips-and-Tricks.rst:194
msgid ""
"Software running on Windows is, in general, much slower than that running"

"slice (every 20 ms, according to the `documentation "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/windows/win32/procthread/multitasking>`__), to the number of anti-"
"virus and anti-malware processes running, to the number of background "
"processes running. Because of all of this, tests should *never* expect "
"tight timing on Windows. All tests should have generous timeouts, and "
"only expect events to happen eventually (this will also prevent tests "
"from being flakey on Linux)."
