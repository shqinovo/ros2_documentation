"Parameters in ROS 2 are associated with individual nodes. Parameters are "
"used to configure nodes at startup (and during runtime), without changing"
" the code. The lifetime of a parameter is tied to the lifetime of the "
"node (though the node could implement some sort of persistence to reload "
"values after restart)."

"Parameters are addressed by node name, node namespace, parameter name, "
"and parameter namespace. Providing a parameter namespace is optional."

"Each parameter consists of a key, a value, and a descriptor. The key is a"
" string and the value is one of the following types: ``bool``, ``int64``,"
" ``float64``, ``string``, ``byte[]``, ``bool[]``, ``int64[]``, "
"``float64[]`` or ``string[]``. By default all descriptors are empty, but "
"can contain parameter descriptions, value ranges, type information, and "
"additional constraints."

"By default, a node needs to *declare* all of the parameters that it will "

"If a parameter needs to be multiple different types, and the code using "

"A ROS 2 node can register three different types of callbacks to be "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:57
msgid ""
"The first is known as a \"pre set parameter\" callback, and can be set by"
" calling ``add_pre_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. This "
"callback is passed a list of the ``Parameter`` objects that are being "
"changed, and returns nothing. When it is called, it can modify the "
"``Parameter`` list to change, add, or remove entries. As an example, if "
"``parameter2`` should change anytime that ``parameter1`` changes, that "
"can be implemented with this callback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:62
msgid ""
"The second is known as a \"set parameter\" callback, and can be set by "
"calling ``add_on_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. The "
"callback is passed a list of immutable ``Parameter`` objects, and returns"
" an ``rcl_interfaces/msg/SetParametersResult``. The main purpose of this "
"callback is to give the user the ability to inspect the upcoming change "
"to the parameter and explicitly reject the change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:67
msgid ""
"It is important that \"set parameter\" callbacks have no side-effects. "
"Since multiple \"set parameter\" callbacks can be chained, there is no "
"way for an individual callback to know if a later callback will reject "
"the update. If the individual callback were to make changes to the class "
"it is in, for instance, it may get out-of-sync with the actual parameter."
" To get a callback *after* a parameter has been successfully changed, see"
" the next type of callback below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The third type of callback is known as an \"post set parameter\" "
"callback, and can be set by calling ``add_post_set_parameters_callback`` "
"from the node API. The callback is passed a list of immutable "
"``Parameter`` objects, and returns nothing. The main purpose of this "
"callback is to give the user the ability to react to changes from "
"parameters that have successfully been accepted."
