"In this tutorial, we’re going to revise the R2D2 model we made in the "
":doc:`previous tutorial <./Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-"
"Scratch>` so that it has movable joints. In the previous model, all of "
"the joints were fixed. Now we’ll explore three other important types of "
"joints: continuous, revolute and prismatic."

"These joints cannot be specified by just one number, and therefore aren’t"

"As you move the sliders around in the GUI, the model moves in Rviz. How "
"is this done? First the `GUI "
"<https://index.ros.org/p/joint_state_publisher_gui>`_ parses the URDF and"
" finds all the non-fixed joints and their limits. Then, it uses the "
"values of the sliders to publish `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState "
"<https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/eloquent/sensor_msgs/msg/JointState.msg>`_"
" messages. Those are then used by `robot_state_publisher "
"<https://index.ros.org/p/robot_state_publisher>`_ to calculate all of "
"transforms between the different parts. The resulting transform tree is "
"then used to display all of the shapes in Rviz."
