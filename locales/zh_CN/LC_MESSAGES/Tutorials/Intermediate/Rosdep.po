msgid ""
"``rosdep`` is a dependency management utility that can work with packages"
" and external libraries. It is a command-line utility for identifying and"
" installing dependencies to build or install a package. ``rosdep`` is "
"*not* a package manager in its own right; it is a meta-package manager "
"that uses its own knowledge of the system and the dependencies to find "
"the appropriate package to install on a particular platform. The actual "
"installation is done using the system package manager (e.g. ``apt`` on "
"Debian/Ubuntu, ``dnf`` on Fedora/RHEL, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Tutorials/Intermediate/Rosdep.rst:33

"It is most often invoked before building a workspace, where it is used to"
" install the dependencies of the packages within that workspace."

msgid ""
"While the name suggests it is for ROS, ``rosdep`` is semi-agnostic to "
"ROS. You can utilize this powerful tool in non-ROS software projects by "
"installing it as a standalone Python package. Successfully running "
"``rosdep`` relies on ``rosdep keys`` to be available, which can be "
"downloaded from a public git repository with a few simple commands."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Tutorials/Intermediate/Rosdep.rst:46
msgid ""
"The ``package.xml`` is the file in your software where ``rosdep`` finds "
"the set of dependencies. It is important that the list of dependencies in"
" the ``package.xml`` is complete and correct, which allows all of the "
"tooling to determine the packages dependencies. Missing or incorrect "
"dependencies can lead to users not being able to use your package, to "
"packages in a workspace being built out-of-order, and to packages not "
"being able to be released."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Tutorials/Intermediate/Rosdep.rst:50
msgid ""
"The dependencies in the ``package.xml`` file are generally referred to as"
" \"rosdep keys\". These dependencies are manually populated in the "

"exhaustive list of any non-builtin libraries and packages it requires."
