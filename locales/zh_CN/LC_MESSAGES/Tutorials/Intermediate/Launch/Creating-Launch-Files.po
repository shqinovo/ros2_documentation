"The launch system in ROS 2 is responsible for helping the user describe "
"the configuration of their system and then execute it as described. The "
"configuration of the system includes what programs to run, where to run "
"them, what arguments to pass them, and ROS-specific conventions which "
"make it easy to reuse components throughout the system by giving them "
"each a different configuration. It is also responsible for monitoring the"
" state of the processes launched, and reporting and/or reacting to "
"changes in the state of those processes."
