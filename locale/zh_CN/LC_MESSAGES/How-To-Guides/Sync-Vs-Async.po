"This guide is intended to warn users of the risks associated with the "
"Python synchronous service client ``call()`` API. It is very easy to "
"mistakenly cause deadlock when calling services synchronously, so we do "
"not recommend using ``call()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:26
msgid ""
"We provide an example on how to use ``call()`` correctly for experienced "
"users who wish to use synchronous calls and are aware of the pitfalls. We"
" also highlight possible scenarios for deadlock that accompany it."

"Because we recommend avoiding sync calls, this guide will also address "
"the features and usage of the recommended alternative, async calls "

"The C++ service call API is only available in async, so the comparisons "
"and examples in this guide pertain to Python services and clients. The "
"definition of async given here generally applies to C++, with some "
"exceptions."

msgid ""
"A synchronous client will block the calling thread when sending a request"
" to a service until a response has been received; nothing else can happen"
" on that thread during the call. The call can take arbitrary amounts of "
"time to complete. Once complete, the response returns directly to the "
"client."

"The following is an example of how to correctly execute a synchronous "
"service call from a client node, similar to the async node in the "
":doc:`Simple Service and Client <../Tutorials/Beginner-Client-"

"Note inside ``main()`` that the client calls ``rclpy.spin`` in a separate"
" thread. Both ``send_request`` and ``rclpy.spin`` are blocking, so they "
"need to be on separate threads."

"There are several ways that the synchronous ``call()`` API can cause "
"deadlock."

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:96
msgid ""
"As mentioned in the comments of the example above, failing to create a "
"separate thread to spin ``rclpy`` is one cause of deadlock. When a client"
" is blocking a thread waiting for a response, but the response can only "
"be returned on that same thread, the client will never stop waiting, and "
"nothing else can happen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:99
msgid ""
"Another cause of deadlock is blocking ``rclpy.spin`` by calling a service"
" synchronously in a subscription, timer callback or service callback. For"
" example, if the synchronous client's ``send_request`` is placed in a "
"callback:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:113
msgid ""
"Deadlock occurs because ``rclpy.spin`` will not preempt the callback with"
" the ``send_request`` call. In general, callbacks should only perform "
"light and fast operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:118
msgid ""
"When deadlock occurs, you will not receive any indication that the "
"service is blocked. There will be no warning or exception thrown, no "
"indication in the stack trace, and the call will not fail."

"Async calls in ``rclpy`` are entirely safe and the recommended method of "
"calling services. They can be made from anywhere without running the risk"
" of blocking other ROS and non-ROS processes, unlike sync calls."

msgid ""
"An asynchronous client will immediately return ``future``, a value that "
"indicates whether the call and response is finished (not the value of the"
" response itself), after sending a request to a service. The returned "
"``future`` may be queried for a response at any time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:130
msgid ""
"Since sending a request doesnâ€™t block anything, a loop can be used to "
"both spin ``rclpy`` and check ``future`` in the same thread, for example:"

"The :doc:`Simple Service and Client <../Tutorials/Beginner-Client-"

"``future`` using a loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async.rst:141
msgid ""
"The ``future`` can also be retrieved using a timer or callback, like in "
"`this example "
"<https://github.com/ros2/examples/blob/rolling/rclpy/services/minimal_client/examples_rclpy_minimal_client/client_async_callback.py>`_,"
" a dedicated thread, or by another method. It is up to you, as the "

"It is not recommended to implement a synchronous service client. They are"
" susceptible to deadlock, but will not provide any indication of issue "
"when deadlock occurs. If you must use synchronous calls, the example in "
"section `1 Synchronous calls`_ is a safe method of doing so. You should "
"also be aware of the conditions that cause deadlock outlined in section "
"`1.1 Sync deadlock`_. We recommend using async service clients instead."
