"ROS 2 applications typically consist of topics to transmit data from "
"publishers to subscriptions. Basically, subscriptions receive all "
"published data from publishers on the topic. But sometimes, a "
"subscription might be interested in only a subset of the data which is "
"being sent by publishers. A content filtering subscription allows to "
"receive only the data of interest for the application."
