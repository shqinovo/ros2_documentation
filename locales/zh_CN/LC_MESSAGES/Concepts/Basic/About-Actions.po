"In ROS 2, an action refers to a long-running remote procedure call with "
"feedback and the ability to cancel or preempt the goal. For instance, the"
" high-level state machine running a robot may call an action to tell the "
"navigation subsystem to travel to a waypoint, which may take several "
"seconds (or minutes) to do. Along the way, the navigation subsystem can "
"provide feedback on how far along it is, and the high-level state machine"
" has the option to cancel or preempt the travel to that waypoint."

"In ROS 2, actions are expected to be long running procedures, as there is"
" overhead in setting up and monitoring the connection. If you need a "
"short running remote procedure call, consider using a :doc:`service "
"<About-Services>` instead."

"Actions are identified by an action name, which looks much like a topic "

msgid ""
"The action server is the entity that will accept the remote procedure "
"request and perform some procedure on it. It is also responsible for "
"sending out feedback as the action progresses and should react to "
"cancellation/preemption requests. For instance, consider an action to "
"calculate the Fibonacci sequence with the following interface:"

"The action server is the entity that receives this message, starts "
"calculating the sequence up to ``order`` (providing feedback along the "
"way), and finally returns a full result in ``sequence``."

"There should only ever be one action server per action name. It is "
"undefined which action server will receive client requests in the case of"
" multiple action servers on the same action name."

msgid "Action client"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Actions.rst:53
msgid ""
"An action client is an entity that will request a remote action server to"
" perform a procedure on its behalf. Following the example above, the "
"action client is the entity that creates the initial message containing "
"the ``order``, and waits for the action server to compute the sequence "
"and return it (with feedback along the way)."

"Unlike the action server, there can be arbitrary numbers of action "
