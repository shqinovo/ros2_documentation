"Parameters in ROS 2 can be get, set, listed, and described through a set "
"of services as described in :doc:`the concept document <../Concepts/Basic"
"/About-Parameters>`. The ``ros2 param`` command-line tool is a wrapper "
"around these service calls that makes it easy to manipulate parameters "
"from the command-line."

"The value that is passed on the command-line is in YAML, which allows "
"arbitrary YAML expressions to be used. However, it also means that "

"``my_node`` is of type string, the following will not work:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Using-ros2-param.rst:59

"That's because YAML is interpreting \"off\" as a boolean, and "
"``my_string`` is a string type. This can be worked around by using the "
"YAML syntax for explicitly setting strings, e.g.:"

"Additionally, YAML supports heterogeneous lists, containing (say) a "
"string, a boolean, and an integer. However, ROS 2 parameters do not "
"support heterogenous lists, so any YAML list that has multiple types will"
" be interpreted as a string. Assuming that the parameter ``my_int_array``"
