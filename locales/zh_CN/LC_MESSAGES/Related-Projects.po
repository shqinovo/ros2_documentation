"*Hint for developers:* If you maintain a ``README.md`` file in the root "

"repository), this file is rendered into the overview page of your package"
" at `index.ros.org <https://index.ros.org/packages/>`_. The file may be "
"used for documenting your package and supersedes the package "
"documentation pages in the ROS Wiki from ROS 1. See the `fmi_adapter "
"package <https://index.ros.org/p/fmi_adapter/github-boschresearch-"
"fmi_adapter/#foxy>`_ as an example."
