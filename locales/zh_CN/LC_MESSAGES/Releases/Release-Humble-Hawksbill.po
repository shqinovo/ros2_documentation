"When `installing ROS 2 on an Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy host "
"<../../humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html>`__ it is "
"important to update your system before installing ROS 2 packages. It is "
"*particularly* important to make sure that ``systemd`` and ``udev`` are "
"updated to the latest available version otherwise installing ``ros-"
"humble-desktop``, which depends on ``libudev1``, could cause the removal "
"of system critical packages. Details can be found in `ros2/ros2#1272 "

"`proposed solution <https://github.com/colcon/colcon-core/pull/512>`_ "
