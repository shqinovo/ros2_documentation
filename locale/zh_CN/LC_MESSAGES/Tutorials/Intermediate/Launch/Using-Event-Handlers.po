"Launch in ROS 2 is a system that executes and manages user-defined "
"processes. It is responsible for monitoring the state of processes it "
"launched, as well as reporting and reacting to changes in the state of "
"those processes. These changes are called events and can be handled by "
"registering an event handler with the launch system. Event handlers can "
"be registered for specific events and can be useful for monitoring the "
"state of processes. Additionally, they can be used to define a complex "
"set of rules which can be used to dynamically modify the launch file."
