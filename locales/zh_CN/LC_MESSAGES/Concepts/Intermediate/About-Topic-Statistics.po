"ROS 2 provides integrated measurement of statistics for messages received"
" by any subscription. Allowing a user to collect subscription statistics "
"enables them to characterize the performance of their system or aid in "
"diagnosis of any present issues."

"The measurements provided are the received message age and received "
"message period. For each measurement the statistics provided are the "
"average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and sample count. These "
"statistics are calculated in a moving window."

"Each statistic set is calculated in constant time and constant memory by "
"using the utilities implemented in the `libstatistics_collector "
"<https://github.com/ros-tooling/libstatistics_collector>`__ package. When"
" a new message is received by a subscription, this is a new sample for "
"calculation in the current measurement window. The average calculated is "
"simply a `moving average "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`__. The maximum, minimum, "
"and sample count are updated upon receipt of each new sample, whereas the"
" standard deviation is calculated using `Welford's online algorithm "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Welford's_online_algorithm>`__."

msgid ""
"By default, Topic Statistics measurements are not enabled. After enabling"
" this feature for a specific node via the subscription configuration "
"options, both received message age and received message period "
"measurements are enabled for that specific subscription."

"The data is published as a `statistics_msg/msg/MetricsMessage "
"<https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/blob/rolling/statistics_msgs/msg/MetricsMessage.msg>`__"
" at a configurable period (default 1 second) to a configurable topic "
"(default ``/statistics``). Note that the publishing period also serves as"
" the sample collection window period."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Topic-Statistics.rst:53
msgid ""
"Since received message period requires a message timestamp in a header "
"field, empty data is published. That is, all statistics values are NaN if"
" no timestamp is found. Publishing NaN values instead of not publishing "
"at all avoids the absence of a signal problem and is meant to explicitly "
"show that a measurement could not be made."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Topic-Statistics.rst:57
msgid ""
"The first sample of each window for the received message period statistic"
" does not yield a measurement. This is because calculating this statistic"
" requires knowing the time the previous message arrived, so subsequent "
"samples in the window yield measurements."

"Similar to ROS 1 `Topic Statistics "
"<https://wiki.ros.org/Topics#Topic_statistics>`__, both message age and "
"message period are calculated, albeit from the subscription side. Other "
"ROS 1 metrics, e.g., the number of dropped messages or traffic volume, "
"are currently not provided."
