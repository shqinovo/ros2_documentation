"This page provides some guidance on parameter tunings that were found to "
"address issues faced while using various DDS implementations on Linux in "
"real-world situations. It is possible that the issues we identified on "
"Linux or while using one vendor may occur for other platforms and vendors"
" not documented here."

"The recommendations below are starting points for tuning; they worked for"
" specific systems and environments, but the tuning may vary depending on "
"a number of factors. You may need to increase or decrease values while "
"debugging relative to factors like message size, network topology, etc."

"It is important to recognize that tuning parameters can come at a cost to"
" resources, and may affect parts of your system beyond the scope of the "
"desired improvements. The benefits of improving reliability should be "
"weighed against any detriments for each individual case."

"**Issue:** Sending data over lossy (usually WiFi) connections becomes "
"problematic when some IP fragments are dropped, possibly causing the "
"kernel buffer on the receiving side to become full."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:25
msgid ""
"When a UDP packet is missing at least one IP fragment, the rest of the "
"received fragments fill up the kernel buffer. By default, the Linux "
"kernel will time out after 30s of trying to recombine packet fragments. "
"Since the kernel buffer is full at this point (default size is 256KB), no"
" new fragments can come in, and so the connection will seemingly \"hang\""
" for long periods of time."

"This issue is generic across all DDS vendors, so the solutions involve "
"adjusting kernel parameters."

msgid "**Solution:** Use best-effort QoS settings instead of reliable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:33
msgid ""
"Best-effort settings reduce the amount of network traffic since the DDS "
"implementation does not have to incur the overhead of reliable "
"communications, where publishers require acknowledgements for messages "
"sent to subscribers and must resend samples that have not been properly "
"received."
msgstr ""

"If the kernel buffer for IP fragments gets full, though, the symptom is "
"still the same (blocking for 30s). This solution should improve the issue"
" somewhat without having to adjust parameters."

"Significantly increasing this parameter’s value is an attempt to ensure "

"**Issue:** Sending custom messages with large variable-sized arrays of "
"non-primitive types causes high serialization/deserialization overhead "
"and CPU load. This can lead to stalling of the publisher due to excessive"
" time spent in ``publish()`` and tools like ``ros2 topic hz`` under "
"reporting the actual frequency of messages being received. Note that for "
"example ``builtin_interfaces/Time`` is also considered a non-primitive "
"type and will incur higher serialization overhead. Because of the "
"increased serialization overhead, severe performance degradation can be "
"observed when naively transitioning custom message types from ROS 1 to "
"ROS 2."

"**Workaround:** Use multiple arrays of primitives instead of a single "
